# Just like in queries, if the mutation field returns an object type, you can ask for nested fields.
# This can be useful for fetching the new state of an object after an update. 

# While query fields are executed in parallel, mutation fields run in series, one after the other.


# This means if we send two incrementCredits mutations in one request, the first is guaranteed to finish before the second
# begins, ensuring that we don't end up with a race condition with ourselves.
