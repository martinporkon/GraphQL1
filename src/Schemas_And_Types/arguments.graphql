type Starship {# every field on a GraphQL object type can have zero or more arguments
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    length(unit: LengthUnit = METER): Float
}

# all arguments are named, all arguments in GraphQL are passed by name specifically. In this case, the length
# field has one defined argument, unit

# When an argument is optional, we can define a default value - if the unit argument is not passed, it will be set to METER by
# default.
