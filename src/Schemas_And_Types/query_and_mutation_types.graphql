#ID: The ID scalar type represents a unique identifier, 
#often used to refetch an object or as the key for a cache. 
#The ID type is serialized in the same way as a String; however, 
#defining it as an ID signifies that it is not intended to be human‚Äêreadable.

# We can also specift custom scalar types

scalar Date

# Then it is up to our implementation to define how that type should be serialized, deserialized and validated.
# For example, you could specify that the Date type should always be serialized into an integer timestamp, and your client
# should know to expect that format for any date fields.
