# If you are querying a field that returns an interface or a union type, you will need to use inline fragments
# to access data on the underlying concrete type.

query HeroForEpisode($ep: Episode!) {
    hero(episode: $ep) {
        name
        ... on Droid {
            primaryFunction
        }
        ... on Human {
            height
        }
    }
}

# here we will return a Droid or a Human from the server, depending on the Episode argument

# inline fragments --> ... on Droid, ... on Human

# the primarFunciton field will only be executed if the Character returned from hero is of the Droid type.

# named fragments can also be used in the same way, since a named fragment always has a type attached.
